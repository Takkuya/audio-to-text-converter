# A simple audio to text converter using Python!

## Setup
 First you need to create a virtual environment, just type `python -m venv env` in the root folder of your project.

 After that, we are going to access the `env\Scripts` folder and type `activate`. This will activate the virtual environment.

 Then, in the root of our project we can install all the necessary packages running the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

 ## Usage
 It is very simple, first, all the **audio files** need to be inside the **audio** folder, then, we only need to run the `convert_files_to_text` file <br/>

 All the converted files will be in the **text.docx** file.
